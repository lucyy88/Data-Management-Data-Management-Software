#  AI Education Data Management
This project aims to establish a Data Management Plan (DMP) for AI education research, adhering to Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) standards. 

## Description
It focuses on leveraging RSpace and DMPTool for optimal data management, ensuring accurate, transparent, and ethical handling of data. Objectives include creating a standardized DMP, implementing DDI for comprehensive data documentation, and promoting best data management practices. The approach emphasizes secure data storage, ethical data use, and open access, aiming to enhance discoverability, interoperability, and reuse of data in AI education. This endeavor seeks to foster a culture of openness and collaboration in the research community.

## Usage

After installing the project, you can use it to perform arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Here's how you can use the library in your Python scripts:

```python
from arithmetic_lib import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Perform addition
result_add = add(5, 3)
print(f"5 + 3 = {result_add}")

# Perform subtraction
result_subtract = subtract(10, 2)
print(f"10 - 2 = {result_subtract}")

# Perform multiplication
result_multiply = multiply(4, 6)
print(f"4 * 6 = {result_multiply}")

# Perform division
result_divide = divide(20, 5)
print(f"20 / 5 = {result_divide}")
